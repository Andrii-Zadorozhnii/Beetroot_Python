#Task 1

#The Guessing Game.

#Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and lets the user guess what number was generated.
#The result should be sent back to the user via a print statement.

import random

from webcolors import names
random_number = random.randint(1,10)
result = int(input("Chose a number from 1 till 10?: "))

if random_number == result:
    print(
        f'Grate, you win. Number is {random_number}'
    )
else:
    print(
        f'Unfortunately you lose. Win number was {random_number}'
    )


#Task 2

#The birthday greeting program.

#Write a program that takes your name as input, and then your age as input and greets you with the following:

#“Hello <name>, on your next birthday you’ll be <age+1> years”

name = input(
    "Please write your name: "
)
age = int(input(
    "Please write your age: "
))

print(
    f'Hello {name}, on your next birthday you’ll be {age+1} years'
)

# Task 3
#
# Words combination
#
# Create a program that reads an input string and then creates and prints 5 random strings from characters of the input string.
#
# For example, the program obtained the word ‘hello’, so it should print 5 random strings(words) that combine characters
#
# 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' -> 'hlelo', 'olelh', 'loleh' …
# Tips: Use random module to get random char from string)

import random
input_string = input(("Please write some word: "))

for i in range(5):
#    print(random.sample(input_string, len(input_string)))
    print(
        "".join(random.sample(input_string, len(input_string)))
    )
